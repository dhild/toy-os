1: Don't use nasm's debugging symbols in 64-bit mode.
   There seems to be no way to control that the relocation addresses
   are stored as 32-bit addresses, rather than the required 64-bit addresses.

2: Use a canonical address for higher half.
   See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Canonical_form_addresses for an
   explanation, but basically for forward compatibility reasons, 64-bit
   addresses are sign-extended.
